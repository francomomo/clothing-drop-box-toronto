# Clothing Drop-box Location in Toronto

## Introduction

During my four years in university, I moved 6 times in total for various reasons. Every time I moved, I was always frustrated with the amount of stuff I had. The most "disposable" item to throw away is always clothes since they took quite some space and they are relatively cheap if I want to repurchase. For the first four times, I did not think about donating or recycling my clothes. However, starting from the fifth time, I started to look for places online to recycle my clothes. To my surprise, clothing drop-box locations are very scattered and they are not very accessible unless you have a car or live close to the area.

Thus, I want to do an analysis of the clothing drop-box locations in Toronto. I would like to know where is the clothing drop-box located in Toronto and are they really hard to access. The dataset about the clothing drop-box locations in the Open Data Portal on the City of Toronto's website serves as a good source. The data is accessible by going on to their website and downloading the dataset. The analysis will provide interesting insight into the Clothing Drop-Box situation in Toronto.
